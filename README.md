# Python-Tutorial-Website

This is the code for my website that I made for python tutorials. Ive tried multiple ways of publishing the code to the website. I used bootstrap studio but I didnt like how much drag and drop it was. So I decided to use github pages and have the page set to my domain that I own. I like this because I can also do it anywhere, I can just open github, code, check the changes, and im done and good to go.
