                  <p>In this tutorial you will learn the basics of Variables. variables are a very important prt of coding. Without variables a lot of codes arent even able to be ran. Its very important to learn, understand and know how to use variables.</p>
                  <h1>What is a Variable</h1>
                  <p>A variable is a way to store some data. It can be called back to by the code and the data that it has written to it can be read, changed or used for an if type of statement. But it can also be set by the user when the code is ran. A variable is very important in most codes. For example, the Urban Dictionary webscraper tutorial we did earlier. That cant run without variables because it asks the user what word they want to use and it sets the variable to be what the user says. you can also have an unlimited amount of variables.</p>
                  <h1>What it looks like</h1>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;background-color: #f0f0f0;padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;white-space: nowrap;overflow-x: scroll;">X = "JaCrispy"<br>number = 4<br>userchoice = input("What would you like: ")<br>list = ["Python", "Java", "C", "Javascript"]</p>
                  <p>Those are a few examples of variables and how you can put information or data into them. The general way it is done is anyvariablenamehere = whateverdatainanyway. You can just put in text data, like words, by doing  varname = "" with your text inside the "". The next type I showed was a number type. That can be done by varname = 2, just set it equal to a number. And the third type I showed was getting user input. It will get input from the user and than itll set the variable to be whatever the user types in. It can be done by doing varname = input("anytexthere"). And the final way of doing it is a list. Itll make it so the variable has more than one little bit of data. It can be done by doing varname = ["thing1", "Thing2", "thing3"], You need the brackets otherwise it wont work. Youll also need to use the "" and , that are in it. The , acts as a seperator so it knows that its something different and new not just the one piece of data.</p>
                  <h1>Using Variables</h1>
                  <p>Using a variable is needed all the time. There are loads of cases where youll need a variable's data and youll have to read the data from the variable</p>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;background-color: #f0f0f0;padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;white-space: nowrap;overflow-x: scroll;">varname = "Text for Variable"<br>print(varname)</p>
                  <p>Thats one example of how a variables data can be read, through a print statement, when ran it would print the words: Text for Variable. This is because thats the data we have set to the variable. Therefore when it prints the variable, its printing out the data thats assigned to the variable.</p>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;background-color: #f0f0f0;padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;white-space: nowrap;overflow-x: scroll;">varname = input("type your name")<br>print(varname)</p>
                  <p>Thats an example of how input can be used. Whatever the user types in, that is what the variable data is set to so var = input("what is your id? ") than itll wait until the user gives input, after the user types something, than it will be similar to var = "whatever the user types", it pretty much will just assign whatever text data the user types in, into the variabe</p>
                  <h1>Reading the Variable data</h1>
                  <p>In some cases youll just need to read the data, like an if statement. So if the data is something than it will do something else. A good example of where this is used is say you want a users name, and if that users name is something than it wont let the code continue.</p>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;background-color: #f0f0f0;padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;white-space: nowrap;overflow-x: scroll;">name = input("Whats your name? ")<br>if name == "JaCrispy":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Welcome to the code")<br>elif name == "Bobby":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Go Away")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("unknown Name")</p>
                  <p>So what does that do? well if the user inputs the name JaCrispy, than itll print out Welcome. For a if or elif statement to work, you must use ==, one equal sign is for defining a variable and two is for reading it. It says elif for the second one, that stands for else if. Pretty much if you have multiple if statements in a row, you should use elif. So if  the users name is Bob, than itll say go away. And the else: makes it so that if the user types any other name other than JaCrispy or Bob than itll print unknown Name. So it reads the variable data that was given by the user and whatever the data is, the code will respond however you want. This is also a very important feature. If and else statements are used all the time in Python.</p>
                  <h1>Changing a variable</h1>
                  <p>Sometimes youll want to change a variable throughout the code, so for example, there is already a variable set that says Go Away and if your name variable is set to JaCrispy than itll change the first variable to welcome</p>
                  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;background-color: #f0f0f0;padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;white-space: nowrap;overflow-x: scroll;">message = "Go Away<br>name = input("Whats your name? ")<br><br>if name == "JaCrispy":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;message = "Welcome"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print(message)<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print(message)</p>
                  <p>So, its pretty simple to reassign data to a variable. You can just redefine it at any time youd like to. Just remember one = is for defining and == is for reading the data of the variable. If you mix these up than you will get an error.</p>
                  <h1>Thank you for reading</h1>
                  <p>That is the basics of Variables. They are extremely important to Python and its very good to understand them and how they work as well as how to use them.
