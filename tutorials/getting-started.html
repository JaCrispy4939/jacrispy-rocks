                    <p>In this tutorial you will learn the important things that youll need to have or know to start coding with Python. It is important that you have the required things and some base knowledge before you can start coding in Python. This tutorial will set you up with visual studio code but I left some other options linked at the bottom. You should explore the other options and maybe more options by googling.</p>
                    <h1>Step One</h1>
                    <p>I am going to show you guys how to install an IDE. An IDE is a Integrated Development Environment. It is where you write the code and in most cases, you can run the code inside the IDE as well. Without an IDE, its very hard to code. Itll tell you what your errors are, sometimes while writing code itll even show it. Itll also help make it easier to read and understand the code</p>
                    <h1>Installing and Setting up VScode</h1>
                    <p>In order to install visual studio code, you just have to go to their website.<p>
                    <p herf="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Click Here Install Visual Studio Code</p>
                    <p>After installing VScode, open it</p>
                    <p>Youll need to install Python onto visual studio code, see screenshots below</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/basics/exten.PNG" alt="Finding Python" width="1300">
                    <p>After finding the Python extension, youll have to install it. This will allow you to make and run .py files, itll also give you a Python terminal. If you want to use VScode for Python than youll need to install the extension</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/basics/install.PNG" alt="Installing Python" width="1300">
                    <h1>Starting to Code</h1>
                    <p>Now you can click the top button again to open the files. Than you can make a new file, and make sure it ends in .py than itll be a Python file. Than you can open the file and start coding from there.</p>
                    <h1>Other Options</h1>
                    <p>There is other options for IDE's but Visual Studio Code is one of the better ones because its used by a ton of people but it also has support for practically any programming language. But there is other options that you can go with if youd like to. I personally like VScode for a lot of reasons but there is no "Correct" option. All IDE's are good. Just look at some of the options below and decide from there what you want to use.</p>
                    <p>One of those other options is an IDE called PyCharm. It is a IDE for Python only and is another one of the top used IDE's for Python programming. Its used by a lot of people and it also has a ton of very nice features. Just like VScode it also has predictive auto complete. It also has a built in terminal as well. And it is also pretty customizable and can be used to code in other language.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Click here to go to PyCharm</a></p>
                    <p>There also online options, like Repl.it, Repl.it is an online IDE that you can use to code in a webpage. It can also link to github for easier use. It is nice for people at school who cant download anything to their computer, they can just go on the website and start coding.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://replit.com/">Click Here to go to Repl</a></p>
                    <h1>Thank you for reading</h1>
                    <p>I wanted to show how to install VScode because its the one I use personally, I wouldnt only use repl, repl can be a really good choice for if your on the go or a random computer or even a school computer. And you can go on repl's website on your phone and code from there. I do think that PyCharm is a wonderful alternative to VScode, it might even be better. Ill let you guys decide what you think is better.</p>
